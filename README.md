Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
About :
I need a review of the way I write code because I feel it's not good to practice somewhere, and I may have misunderstood things about the project requirements, but I did my best to be appropriate, and I understood the parts I need to practice more and the parts I'm good at, I'm waiting for your review.
